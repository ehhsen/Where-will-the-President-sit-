Dynamic Seating Arrangement for an Event built in C++
Where The President Will Sit 😂🇺🇸
Overview 🎉
Welcome to Where The President Will Sit – a C++ masterpiece that’s less about Oval Office seating and more about juggling conference chaos! This bad boy uses a 2D dynamic array 🧠 to whip up seating plans faster than a caffeine-crazed event planner. Whether it’s adding VIPs 👑, kicking out no-shows 🚪, or finding where Aunt Karen’s hiding 👀, this program’s got your back. It resizes like a stretchy pair of pants after Thanksgiving 🍗 and cleans up its mess with ninja-level memory management 🥷.

Think of it as your sassy sidekick for real-world event shenanigans where seats change more often than a politician’s promises! 🎤

Features 🌟

Find Attendee: Tracks down your VIP (or that guy who stole the snacks) with row-and-column precision 📍.
Interactive Menu: A console menu so easy even your grandma could use it 👵.
