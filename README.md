## Where The President Will Sit 😂🇺🇸

### Overview 🎉
Welcome to *Where The President Will Sit* – a C++ masterpiece that’s less about the **Oval Office** and more about managing conference chaos! This program uses a **2D dynamic array 🧠** to create and manage seating arrangements faster than a caffeine-crazed event planner. Whether it’s **adding VIPs 👑, kicking out no-shows 🚪, or finding Aunt Karen 👀**, this program has you covered. It resizes like **Thanksgiving pants 🍗** and cleans up memory with **ninja-level precision 🥷**.
