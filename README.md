# Where-will-the-President-sit-
Dynamic Seating Arrangement for an Event built in C+=
Overview 🎉
Welcome to "Where The President Will Sit" – a C++ masterpiece that’s less about Oval Office
seating and more about juggling conference chaos! This bad boy uses a 2D dynamic array 🧠
to whip up seating plans faster than a caffeine-crazed event planner. Whether it’s adding
VIPs 👑, kicking out no-shows 🚪, or finding where Aunt Karen’s hiding 👀, this program’s
got your back. It resizes like a stretchy pair of pants after Thanksgiving 🍗 and cleans
up its mess with ninja-level memory management 🥷.

Think of it as your sassy sidekick for real-world event shenanigans where seats change
more often than a politician’s promises! 🎤

Features 🌟
Customizable Seating Layout: You pick the rows and columns – make it a cozy 2x2 or a wild 10x10 circus! 🎪
Dynamic Memory Allocation: A 2D array that grows like a greedy houseplant 🌱, storing names with flair.
Attendee Management:
Add Attendee: Sneaks a newbie into an empty seat or slaps on a new row if we’re packed like sardines 🐟.
Remove Attendee: Yeets someone out and marks their spot "Empty" – bye, Felicia! 👋
Display Arrangement: Shows off the seating chart prettier than a peacock 🦚.
Find Attendee: Tracks down your VIP (or that guy who stole the snacks) with row-and-column precision 📍.
Interactive Menu: A console menu so easy even your grandma could use it 👵.
Memory Management: Cleans up better than a Roomba on steroids 🤖.
Requirements ⚙️
Compiler: Grab a C++ compiler (g++, Visual Studio, whatever) that’s cool with C++11 or later.
Libraries: Just the classics – iostream, iomanip, string, and conio.h for that retro console vibe 📼.
Operating System: Runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS – it’s chill like that 😎.
How to Use 🚀
Compile the Program:
Fire up your compiler and make magic happen. Try this: g++ seating_arrangement.cpp -o where_the_president_will_sit
